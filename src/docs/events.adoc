== Events

Spring Security fires application events after various security-related actions such as successful login, unsuccessful login, and so on. Spring Security uses two main event classes, https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.x/apidocs/org/springframework/security/authentication/event/AbstractAuthenticationEvent.html[AbstractAuthenticationEvent] and https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.x/apidocs/org/springframework/security/access/event/AbstractAuthorizationEvent.html[AbstractAuthorizationEvent].
