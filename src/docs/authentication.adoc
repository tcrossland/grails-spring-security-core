== Authentication

The Spring Security plugin supports several approaches to authentication.

The default approach stores users and roles in your database, and uses an HTML login form which prompts the user for a username and password. The plugin also supports other approaches as described in the sections below, as well as add-on plugins that provide external authentication providers such as https://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-openid[OpenID], https://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-ldap[LDAP], and single sign-on using https://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-cas[CAS]
