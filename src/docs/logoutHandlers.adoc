== Logout Handlers

You register a list of logout handlers by implementing the https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.x/apidocs/org/springframework/security/web/authentication/logout/LogoutHandler.html[LogoutHandler] interface. The list is called when a user explicitly logs out.

By default, a `securityContextLogoutHandler` bean is registered to clear the https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.x/apidocs/org/springframework/security/core/context/SecurityContextHolder.html[SecurityContextHolder]. Also, unless you are using Facebook or OpenID, `rememberMeServices` bean is registered to reset your cookie. (Facebook and OpenID authenticate externally so we don't have access to the password to create a remember-me cookie.) If you are using Facebook, a `facebookLogoutHandler` is registered to reset its session cookies.

To customize this list, you define a `logout.handlerNames` attribute with a list of bean names.

| *Property* | *Default Value* | *Meaning*
| logout.handlerNames | ['rememberMeServices', 'securityContextLogoutHandler'] | Logout handler bean names.
|====================

The beans must be declared either by the plugin or by you in `resources.groovy`. For example, suppose you have a custom `MyLogoutHandler` in `resources.groovy`:

[source,java]
----
import com.foo.MyLogoutHandler

beans = {
   myLogoutHandler(MyLogoutHandler) {
      // attributes
   }
}
----

You register it in `grails-app/conf/application.groovy` as:

[source,java]
----
grails.plugin.springsecurity.logout.handlerNames = [
   'rememberMeServices', 'securityContextLogoutHandler', 'myLogoutHandler'
]
----
