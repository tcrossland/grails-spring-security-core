[[x509]]
=== Certificate (X.509) Login Authentication

Another authentication mechanism supported by Spring Security is certificate-based, or "`mutual authentication`". It requires HTTPS, and you must configure the server to require a client certificate (ordinarily only the server provides a certificate). Your username is extracted from the client certificate if it is valid, and you are "`pre-authenticated`". As long as a corresponding username exists in the database, your authentication succeeds and you are not asked for a password. Your `Authentication` contains the authorities associated with your username.

The table describes available configuration options.

|====================
| *Property* | *Default Value* | *Meaning*
| useX509 | `false` | Whether to support certificate-based logins
| x509.continueFilterChainOn UnsuccessfulAuthentication | `true` | Whether to proceed when an authentication attempt fails to allow other authentication mechanisms to process the request.
| x509.subjectDnRegex | '`CN=(.*?)(?:,\|$)`' | Regular expression (regex) for extracting the username from the certificate's subject name.
| x509.checkForPrincipalChanges | `false` | Whether to re-extract the username from the certificate and check that it's still the current user when a valid `Authentication` already exists.
| x509.invalidateSessionOn PrincipalChange | `true` | Whether to invalidate the session if the principal changed (based on a `checkForPrincipalChanges` check).
| x509.subjectDnClosure | none | If set, the plugin's `ClosureX509PrincipalExtractor` class is used to extract information from the X.509 certificate using the specified closure
| x509. throwException WhenTokenRejected | `false` | If `true` thrown a `BadCredentialsException`

The details of configuring your server for SSL and configuring browser certificates are beyond the scope of this document. If you use Tomcat, see its https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/ssl-howto.html[SSL documentation]. To get a test environment working, see the instructions in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1180397/tomcat-server-client-self-signed-ssl-certificate[this discussion at Stack Overflow].
